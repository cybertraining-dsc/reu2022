# Communications with C4GC Students

* There are weekly meetings with Ben Hurt every Tuesday and Wednesday from 11-11:45 am on Zoom and in room 4402.
* Around 4 students present each at the meetings. Every student presents twice and the link to the schedule can be found [at this link.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_A4Gp7HL4EV4WvQpnFMiMAAArnFcfZDCyEhJ85NxG1c/edit)
    * first presentation is about the student's goals and the introduction to the project: 
        * How you define success for this summer
        * Who you’re working with
        * What your project is
        * What you’ve done so far
        * [optional] What challenges you’ve faced so far
    * It should be around 5-7 minutes long.
* The students within this REU found that the timing of the meetings for the C4GC meetings was not good, as it interrupted the thoughts from morning programming and discussion. The reason for this is that the students started at 8am with Professor von Lazsewski and met for between 30 minutes and a few hours every morning. Then, the students would have only a short time after the morning meeting to start work before the meeting with Benjamin Hurt. It would have been more efficient to have these meetings at the end of the day. It could be something to look forward to and something to help keep focus.
* Rivanna Orientation (C4GC specific) on Thursday June 9, 10 am - 11 am.
