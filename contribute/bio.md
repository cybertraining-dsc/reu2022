# Bios

In this section we provide a number of bios from a subset of students that 
have contributed to this effort in IEEE format.

## Alex Beck

Alex Beck has completed his first year at the University of Virginia where he is 
majoring in electrical engineering. He is set to receive his Bachelor of Science degree
in the Spring of 2025.

Alex worked in the summer of 2022 at the UVA Biocomplexity 
Institute's Computing for Global Challenges program under Dr. Gregor von Laszewski
where he gained experience in programming and data science. Prior to 
that, he had previous experience in sales from working in retail. 

At UVA, Alex is involved in a few extracurricular organizations. He is currently active
in the Virginia Eta Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon, the UVA Climbing Team, and the 
UVA Chapter of the QuestBridge Scholars Network.

## Alison Lu

Alison Lu has completed her second year (Class of 2024) at the University of Virginia pursuing a
double major in CS and Chemistry with a minor in Japanese. She is conducting research with the
physics department studying quantum computing and photon resolution using machine learning. In 
addition, she works with UVA's Repair Lab to study gentrification in Norfolk, VA.

She participated in the Biocomplexity Institute's C4GC REU program. Her 
interests include computer architecture, machine learning, and quantum 
computing alongside quantum mechanics.

## Jackson Miskill

Jackson Miskill has completed his second year at the University
of Virginia where he is studying Computer Science and Cognitive
Science. He will receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from UVa in
Spring of 2024. Jackson has studied python and java in his courses,
delving into concepts from basic syntax to data structures and algorithms. 

Jackson worked with the UVA Biocomplexity Institute 
under Dr. Gregor von Laszewski as a part of the Computing for 
Global Challenges program. He is studying the intersection
between Python and cloud computing. In the future, Jackson plans
to continue research. 

## Jacques Fleischer

Jacques Fleischer is a sophomore at the Miami Dade Honors College. 
He is set to receive his associate degree in computer science in 
summer 2022. He received the Miami Dade Honors College Fellows 
Award.

In the summer of 2021, he participated in the Florida-Georgia 
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation REU Data
Science and AI Research Program; his research focused on 
predicting the price of cryptocurrency using artificial
intelligence. This was done in conjunction with faculty from 
Florida A&M University and Indiana University. He presented
his findings at the Miami Dade College School of Science 
Symposium in October 2021. Jacques was accepted to the 2022
Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM after 
applying with his abstract on cryptocurrency time-series.
Additionally, he was one of four Miami Dade College students 
to be nominated for the Barry Goldwater Scholarship due to
his research findings.

Jacques is active in extracurriculars; for instance, he is the 
current Vice President of the MDC Computer Club. There, he hosts 
virtual workshops on how to use computer software, including 
Adobe Premiere Pro and PyCharm. He is also a member of Phi Theta 
Kappa. Furthermore, he is an active contributor to Cloudmesh: an 
open-source, all-in-one grid-computing solution written in 
Python. He presently participates in the University of Virginiaâ€™s 
Computing for Global Challenges program with Dr. 
Gregor von Laszewski to find high performance computing solutions using Raspberry Pis.

## Eric He

Junyang (Eric) He completed his first year of study at the University of 
Virginia majoring in Computer Science. He anticipates to receive his B.S. in 
Computer Science in 2025. He is currently a member of the Engineering Student
Council and the Chinese Student and Scholars Society at UVA.

In the summer of 2021, Eric worked as a Data Analyst intern at Nint (Shanghai)
Co., Ltd, a company that provides market data analysis products for E-commerce
His work included time series data cleaning and natural language processing.

Eric is currently conducting research with Prof. Geoffrey C. Fox on a 
Deep Learning model based on LSTM networks trained to predict hydrological 
features like streamflow, precipitation, and temperature at different locations 
in the US. He focused primarily on the possibilities of extending the model to 
countries outside of the US such as Chile and UK. 


## Abdulbaqiy Diyaolu
 
AbdulBaqiy Diyaolu is an undergraduate Computer Science and Mathematics Major 
from Mississippi Valley State University. AbdulBaqiy is currently a 
presidential scholar at such university.

AbdulBaqiy currently works at Fedex Logistics at MVSU. He helps in
data entry and data Analysis. He is hoping to polish his data analysis
skills with this opportunity. In the summer of 2022, he partially participated 
in the Biocomplexity Research Program at UVA where he started to learn 
elementary python programming.

AbdulBaqiy participates in several extracurricular activities. In MVSU he
is a member of African Student Union (ASU), National Society of Black Engineers
(NSBE), and the Google Developer's Club. He is also a Strada Scholar at MVSU
where he participates in several leadership development activities.

## Thomas Butler

Thomas Butler is a Graduate Student at University of Virginia's School of Data 
Science. His undergraduate degree is in Biomedical engineering. He has over 
eight years of experience in the Infertility field helping patients, jointly
