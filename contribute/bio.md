Jacques Fleischer is a sophomore at the Miami Dade Honors College. 
He is set to receive his associate degree in computer science in 
summer 2022. He received the Miami Dade Honors College Fellows 
Award and currently maintains a 4.0 GPA on the Dean’s List.

In the summer of 2021, he participated in the Florida-Georgia 
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation REU Data
Science and AI Research Program; his research focused on 
predicting the price of cryptocurrency using artificial
intelligence. This was done in conjunction with faculty from 
Florida A&M University and Indiana University. He presented
his findings at the Miami Dade College School of Science 
Symposium in October 2021. Jacques was accepted to the 2022
Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM after 
applying with his abstract on cryptocurrency time-series.
Additionally, he was one of four Miami Dade College students 
to be nominated for the Barry Goldwater Scholarship due to
his research findings.

Jacques is active in extracurriculars; for instance, he is the 
current Vice President of the MDC Computer Club. There, he hosts 
virtual workshops on how to use computer software, including 
Adobe Premiere Pro and PyCharm. He is also a member of Phi Theta 
Kappa. Furthermore, he is an active contributor to Cloudmesh: an 
open-source, all-in-one grid-computing solution written in 
Python. He presently participates in the University of Virginia’s 
Computing for Global Challenges program with Dr. 
Gregor von Laszewski and Dr. Geoffrey C. Fox to find high 
performance computing solutions using Raspberry Pis.

## Eric He

Junyang (Eric) He completed his first year of study at the University of 
Virginia majoring in Computer Science. He anticipates to receive his B.S. in 
Computer Science in 2025. He is currently a member of the Engineering Student
Council and the Chinese Student and Scholars Society at UVA.

In the summer of 2021, Eric worked as a Data Analyst intern at Nint (Shanghai)
Co., Ltd, a company that provides market data analysis products for E-commerce
His work included time series data cleaning and natural language processing.

Eric is currently conducting research with Prof. Geoffrey C. Fox on a 
Deep Learning model based on LSTM networks trained to predict hydrological 
features like streamflow, precipitation, and temperature at different locations 
in the US. He focused primarily on the possibilities of extending the model to 
countries outside of the US such as Chile and UK. 


## Abdulbaqiy Diyaolu
 
AbdulBaqiy Diyaolu is a Computer science and Mathematics Major from
Mississippi Valley State University. He will be receiving his bachelor's
