# Avoid Duplication

Before you do anything, check first if it is already in one of the
books.  Evaluate if it needs to be expanded in the book, or if a new
section is needed.  If a new section is needed, please consult with
Gregor and ask for approval. We will then also decide if the chapter
will be located in [reu2022](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022) or in [book](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book) (both are repositories).
