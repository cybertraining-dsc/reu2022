such a fashion that the final lines will be considered. For example let
us assume you spent significant time on a section that ia a
duplication of what others do, we will then delete that sections and
you have not achieved a contribution. Thus, please make sure that you contribute valuable things.

Ask if you have an idea and want confirmation.
