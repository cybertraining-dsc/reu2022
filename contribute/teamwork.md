* Principals of Teamwork

---

1. Team works together
2. Team always communicates with each other
3. A canceled meeting for a dasy does not mean that the teamwork stops
4. If you need help you must ask the team
5. If a team member does not want to help you that is not team work
6. If you can not keep up with the team memberes you need to step up
7. If you are assigned a task and you can not do it you need to ask for help
8. If you spend hours or days on a task that you can not do you need to ask for help
9. In case you know you have an issue with a task you need to communicate that early
10. In case you need to go on vacation 2 weeks before the REU is over, this request will be denied
11. In case you do need to go on vacation, you need to provied a concrete plan 
    on (a) how does this work effect the team and how will your work be distributed 
    to the team, (b) what are concrete workhours that you propose to make up the work (c) be aware that 
    any vacation time not only negatively impacts the team time planing, but also your supervisors work 
    (d) plan any additional impact on your work, for example you could have other obligations in unrelated projects. 

Always ask yourself everyday:

* What have you done to increase teamwork?
* What is a concrete contribution you made for the team?
* Did you help enyone?
* Were you helped by anyone?
* Did you communicate your progress?
