### Contributing

Create the volume


To create this volume yourself, which is useful if you like to
contribute, create a git clone, check out your clone 

```
cd book/writing
```

make your modifications and verify them with

```
make
make view
```

After you are satisfied do a pull request. As you are working in
parallel, it is best to focus on small pull request that are done to a
single section or issue. Do not create a pull request that is done
over a long period of time. This may fore sure result in conflicts
with others.

### Direct edit via Github.com GUI

It is also possible to directly contribute to the volume while using
the :cloud: (Cloud) links in case you find a contribution you like to
make, locate the closest preceding cloud and click on it. It allows
you to create a pull request  that you can edit directly and thus
provides the ability to make changes very quickly without the need of
a complete checkout. However we ask you to carefully review your
changes. Furthermore, as you work on a browser window the changes
should be small and we recommend for larger changes to first write the
section you like to change in a local editor and than paste the
changes into the GUI. This helps avoiding losing your text in case of
network outages and minimises conflicts with others.
