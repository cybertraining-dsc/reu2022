# Teaching Material and Course Websites

Teaching material form previous teaching activities was made available to the 
students at the beginning of the program. We list here a selection of them. 
Students were required to find other resources on the internet in case 
additional material was needed. This served as an exercise to be able to 
identify relevant information.

Students main goal was to develop new teaching material while at the
same time conducting a project making the use of distributed
cyberinfrastructure for deep learning simpler. Over time, they
contributed to the teaching material.
