Teching material form previous teaching activities was made avilable to the students at the beginning of
the program. We list here a selection of them. Students were required to find other resources on the internet in case additinal material was needed. THis sevred as excersise to be able to identify relevant information.

Students main goal was to develop new teachng material while at the
same time conducting a project making the use of distributed
cyberinfrastructure for deep learning simpler. Over time they
contributed to the teaching material.
