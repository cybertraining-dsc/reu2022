* Learn how to use deep learning for time series analysis

create and document a simple time series command

use cloudmesh sys command generate to create an extension so we can do a commandline tool 

```
cms timeseries --config=CONFIG
```

where the config file is a yaml file.

Work with Gregor as he will create a separate github repo for this and create the command template 
so you can fill it out with content.
