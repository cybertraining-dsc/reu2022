Students who are collaborating with UVA and joining the cloudmesh
or mlcommons initiative should become acquainted with documentation
that will assist them in development.

First of all, those using a Windows computer for development must
follow a different configuration. Follow the complete tutorial located
at <https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/windows-configuration.md>

Secondly, documentation on how to use the UVA Anywhere VPN
can be found at the following link: <https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/hpc/rivanna-introduction.md#connecting-to-uva-anywhere-vpn-via-cli>

Once achieving a connection to Rivanna by setting up the VPN,
follow the setup at the following link <https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/hpc/rivanna-introduction.md#logging-in-to-rivanna-via-web-interface> which involves copying an ssh key for automated login.

Please sign up on Wednesdays for a UVA Rivanna tutorial. The list of
