# Necessary Steps to Research with Python at UVA

Students who are collaborating with UVA and joining the cloudmesh
or mlcommons initiative should become acquainted with documentation
that will assist them in development.

First of all, those using a Windows computer for development must
follow a different configuration. Follow the complete tutorial located
at 
<https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/windows-configuration.md>

Secondly, set up Python and a virtual environment using the following
tutorial: 
<https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/install.md>

Thirdly, documentation on how to use the UVA Anywhere VPN
can be found at the following link: 
<https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/hpc/rivanna-introduction.md#connecting-to-uva-anywhere-vpn-via-cli>

Once achieving a connection to Rivanna by setting up the VPN,
follow the setup at the following link 
<https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/hpc/rivanna-introduction.md#logging-in-to-rivanna-via-web-interface> 
which involves copying an ssh key for automated login
into Rivanna.

Those who will be researching MPI on Rivanna should become acquainted
with the following Rivanna documentation page: 
<https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/software/mpi/>

Please sign up on Wednesdays for a UVA Rivanna tutorial. The list of
workshops can be seen at the following link: 
<https://www.rc.virginia.edu/education/workshops/>

When working with Gregor please use terminals and code editors with
light themes, as it is difficult to read otherwise. For example,
use IntelliJ light with PyCharm
