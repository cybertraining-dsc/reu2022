# Comparision Table

Although Matplotlib is the main plotting interface, several other libraries include simple visualization options. We
have created a comparison table to showcase the differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, and Pandas.

The full set of graphing options for Matplotlib is displayed in the 
[Matplotlib Gallery](<https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/gallery/index.html>).

While Matplotlib has the most options for all varieties of graphs, Seaborn specializes in color palettes for such graphs
while Bokeh's specialty is an interactive `.html` graph that opens in the web browser and can be scrolled and explored.

Meanwhile, Pandas is a very popular data manipulation tool. Its special feature is the data frame, a special way to
store data. Thus, visualizing data created through Pandas requires understanding how data frames work.

Next is a tutorial on some simple visualization tools we can use with each library.
