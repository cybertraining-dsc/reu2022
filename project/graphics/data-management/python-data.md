# Python Data Management for Visualizations

In python, there are several ways that data can be interpreted in
order to generate the graphics for data visualization.

Through several examples, we will show how to manage different types
of data and how to best interact with them. They are lists,
dictionaries and CSV files.

## Lists

Lists are clumps of continuous values that are put directly next to
each other in the computer memory system.

### Construction

In python, lists can be constructed like this:

```python
example_list = ['example' , 2, 'b', 45, False]
```

Lists have order and can hold many types (bool, int, String, etc.) of
values.

### Accessing Values

In python, it is easy to access values within a list. The following
code provides an example of how to access certain values within a
list:

```python
index_4 = example_list[4]
```

It is important to note that lists have indices, which range from 0 to
the length of the list - 1. The indices provide access to values
within the list.

### Updating Values

To update a value within a list, simply utilize same brackets:

```python
example_list[3] = 'bear'
```

This will change the value at the third index from 45 to bear. 

### Python Built-In Methods

Python has several built-in methods for lists. These include `append()`, `clear()`
`copy()`, `count()`, `extend()`, `index()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `remove(`, `reverse()`,
and `sort()`. 

A user can utilize these methods to make changes in the necessary ways to the list. 

### Examples

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are like specialized lists. They hold a key-value pair
that allows for a user to look up a key and find the associated
value. Dictionaries are useful for storing values in a way that is
more organized than a linear list. Furthermore, dictionaries make it
easy for users to look up the necessary information.

### Construction

In python, dictionaries are constructed as follows:

```python
example_dictionary = {'motorcycles': 2, 'autocycles': 3,
		      'cars': 4, 'small_trucks': 6
                      'large_trucks': '18'}
```

The string values are the keys, which provide access to the values
within the dictionary.  The colon provides the computer with the
command for assigning key-value pair.

### Accessing Values

There are several built-in commands to access both the keys and values
in a dictionary.  They are as follows:

```python
example_dictionary.get()
example_dicionary.keys()
example_dictionary.values()
```

The `.get()` method returns the value that is associated with the
given key, the `.keys()` method returns a list of the keys alone, and
the `.values()` method returns a list of the values alone. There are
more methods (see the Python Built-In Methods section)

### Updating Values

To update the dictionary, there is one method that can be used:

```python
example_dictionary.update({'motorcycles': 20})
```

This will update the value associated with this particular key-value pair. 

### Python Built-In Methods

There are several built-in methods that allow for more dictionary
manipulation: They are `clear()`, `copy()`, `fromkeys()`, `items()`,
`pop()`, `popitem()`, and `setdefault()`.

### Examples


## CSV Files 

CSV stands for *comma-separated-values* and is a data structure that
is incredibly common for data management and analysis. There are many
ways to access CSV files.  The most common way is to use pandas, a
python library. However, python also has a built-in CSV module that
can be used. We will show examples of using both below.

### Installing and Importing

Before beginning with any of these CSV manipulation tasks, it is
necessary to install and import the correct modules and libraries. The
following showcases this:

```bash
$ pip install pandas
```

```python
import pandas as pd 
import csv
```

### Construction

CSV files are files that exist elsewhere and have already been
created.  Therefore, for creation, we are not creating a CSV files,
but rather deconstructing it into something that is usable.

In pandas, this means creating a dataframe, which is essentially and
indexed table.  In the python `csv` module, this means using the
`csvreader` object within the module.  Following are two examples
showcasing how exactly to do this.

For the `csv` module:

```python
# open the csv and creates the reader object for it
file = open('/Users/jacksonmiskill/Downloads/biostats.csv')

reader = csv.reader(file)
```

The `reader` is an object that was created by python developers to
help parse through the `csv` files.

For the `pandas` module:

```python
file = pd.read_csv("/Users/jacksonmiskill/Downloads/biostats.csv")
df = pd.DataFrame(file)
```

### Accessing Values

For the `csv` module:

It is more challenging to access files using the `csv` module as
opposed to the `pandas` library. To make it more simple, it is
necessary to convert the values that lie within the `csv` into a list
in order to access.

```python
data = []
for each_row in reader:
    if each_row: # you have to check for blank lines within the document
        data.append(each_row[2])

print(data)
```

This code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/graphics/data-management/python-data.py)

For the `pandas` module, it is less complicated to access that
values. This is because the module includes a function that converts
the data into a dataframe.  After converting, you can use the various
methods that are within the dataframe to essentially pass in the
correct values.

### Examples

Once the `csv` values have been accessed, creation of the graphics can
begin. Starting with the `csv` module and then moving into `pandas`
the following will demonstrate this action.

The `csv` file that will be utilized for the following examples can be
found
[here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html). It
represents made up data on a group of made up people such as age,
height, and weight.

It is slow and complicated to create graphs with the `csv`
module:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

names = []
sex_data = []
age_data = []
height_data = []
weight_data = []

with open('/Users/jacksonmiskill/Downloads/biostats.csv',
          'r') as file:  # opens the csv and creates the reader object for it
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')

    for each_row in reader:
        if each_row:  # you have to check for blank lines within the document

            names.append(each_row[0])
            sex_data.append(each_row[1])
            age_data.append(each_row[2])
            height_data.append(each_row[3])
            weight_data.append(each_row[4])

# Have to clean the data in order to actually create the graphs. 
names.pop(0)
height_data.pop(0)
for i in range(0, len(height_data)):
    height_data[i] = int(height_data[i])

# let's plot the heights and weight of everyone. We could maybe use a hue here to denote who it is
plt.plot(names, height_data)
plt.xlabel("Name")
plt.ylabel("Height")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.savefig('images/csv-lineplot.png')
plt.savefig('images/csv-lineplot.svg')
plt.savefig('images/pandas-lineplot.pdf')
plt.legend()
plt.title("Names and Corresponding Height")
plt.show()
```

[GitHub](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/graphics/data-management/python-data.py)

This code produces Figure *csv-lineplot*:

Figure *csv-lineplot*: created using the data available [here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html). 


***How do we use csv module without having to clean the data? ***


It is so much more simple to accomplish this with the `pandas`
library:

```python
file = pd.read_csv("/Users/jacksonmiskill/Downloads/biostats.csv")
biostats = pd.DataFrame(file)

plt.plot(biostats['Name'], biostats[' "Height (in)"'])
plt.xlabel("Name")
plt.ylabel("Height")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.savefig('images/pandas-lineplot.png')
plt.savefig('images/pandas-lineplot.svg')
plt.savefig('images/pandas-lineplot.pdf')
plt.title("Names and Corresponding Height")
plt.show()
```

This code can be accessed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/reu2022/blob/main/project/graphics/data-management/python-data.py)

This code produces the Figure *pandas-lineplot*:

![matplotlib lineplot](images/pandas-lineplot.svg)

Figure *pandas-lineplot*: created using the data available [here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html).
