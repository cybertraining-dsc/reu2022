In Python, data and equations can be visually represented using graphs
and plots. Here we showcase how to use the different plotting
libraries Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Seaborn.

For each of these frameworks exist an extensive example set as part of Galleries
included with the original documentation. We encourage to browse through these
examples to identfy plots that you may want to generate.

* [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)
* [seaborn gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)
* [bokeh gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html)
* [pandas gallery](TODO)

Another combined gallery is available as

* (interactive selection)[https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/]

And provides you with choices based on your selection.
