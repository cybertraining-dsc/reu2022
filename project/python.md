## Queue

A queue is a data structure. Essentially, it is a list that has order,
meaning that the queue has an object to be removed first and an 
object to be removed last.

There are three types of queues. The first is FIFO, which stands for
first in, first out. This means that the first element that is added
to the data structure is the first element that is pulled from the data
structure. The second type if LIFO, which stands for Last in, First out. 
This means that the element that was last added to the queue is the 
element that will be removed first. Finally, there is a priority queue.
In a priority queue, the element that is removed first is the element with
the lowest value for a priority (meaning the highest priority). 

Fortunately, python has a built-in queue module. To access, simply
type:

```python
import queue
```

Then, the data structures can be built as follows:

### FIFO Queue



### LIFO Queue

### Priority Queue
