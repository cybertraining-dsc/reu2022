#  Transportation Systems


This section discusses the transportation systems


1.  The ride-hailing industry highlights the growth of a new
    "Transportation System" TS a. For ride-hailing TS controls rides
    matching drivers and customers; it predicts how to position cars and
    how to avoid traffic slowdowns b. However, TS is much bigger outside
    ride-hailing as we move into the "connected vehicle" era c. TS will
    probably find autonomous vehicles easier to deal with than human
    drivers
2.  Cloud Fog and Edge components
3.  Autonomous AI was centered on generalized image processing
4.  TS also needs AI (and DL) but this is for routing and geospatial
    time-series; different technologies from those for image processing

## Different AI Approaches in Ride-Hailing (C)

1.  View as a Time Series: LSTM and ARIMA
2.  View as an image in a 2D earth surface - Convolutional networks
3.  Use of Graph Neural Nets
4.  Use of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Nets
5.  Spatio-temporal modeling
6.  Comparison of data with predictions
7.  Reinforcement Learning
8.  Formulation of General Geospatial Time-Series Problem
