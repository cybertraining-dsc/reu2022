# Mobility (Industry)


This section discusses the mobility in Industry

1.  Industry being transformed by a) Autonomy (AI) and b) Electric power
2.  Established Organizations cannot change
    -   General Motors (employees: 225,000 in 2016 to around 180,000
        in 2018) finds it hard to compete with Tesla (42000 employees)
    -   Market value GM was half the market value of Tesla at the start
        of 2020 but is now just 11% October 2020
    -   GM purchased Cruise to compete
    -   Funding and then buying startups is an important
        "transformation" strategy
3.  Autonomy needs Sensors Computers Algorithms and Software
    -   Also experience (training data)
    -   Algorithms main bottleneck; others will automatically improve
        although lots of interesting work in new sensors, computers and
        software
    -   Over the last 3 years, electrical power has gone from
        interesting to "bound to happen"; Tesla's happy customers
        probably contribute to this
    -   Batteries and Charging stations needed
