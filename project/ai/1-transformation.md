#   Overview to AI-Driven Digital Transformation

An introductory Lecture with Motivation
for Big Data Applications and Analytics Class. 

This Lecture is recorded in 8 parts and gives an introduction and
motivation for the class. This and other lectures in class are divided
into "bite-sized lessons" from 5 to 30 minutes in length; that is why it
has 8 parts.

The lecture explains what students might gain from the class even if they
end up with different types of jobs from data engineering, software
engineering, data science or a business (application) expert. It
stresses that we are well into a transformation that impacts industry
research and the way life is lived. This transformation is centered on
using the digital way with clouds, edge computing and deep learning
giving the implementation. This "AI-Driven Digital Transformation" is as
transformational as the Industrial Revolution in the past. We note that
deep learning dominates most innovative AI replacing several traditional
machine learning methods.

##  Big Data Applications and Analytics (A)

This lesson describes briefly the trends driving and consequent of the
AI-Driven Digital Transformation. It discusses the organizational
aspects of the class and notes the two driving trends are clouds and AI.
Clouds are mature and a dominant presence. AI is still rapidly changing
and we can expect further major changes. The edge (devices and
associated local fog computing) has always been important but now more
is being done there.

##  Big Data Applications and Analytics (B)

This lesson goes through the technologies (AI Edge Cloud) from 2008-2020
that are driving the AI-Driven Digital Transformation. we use Hype
Cycles and Priority Matrices from Gartner tracking importance concepts
from the Innovation Trigger, Peak of Inflated Expectations through the
Plateau of Productivity. We contrast clouds and AI.
