#  Introduction to AI in Health and Medicine

This module discusses AI and the digital transformation for the Health
and Medicine Area with a special emphasis on COVID-19 issues. We cover
both the impact of COVID and some of the many activities that are
addressing it. Parts B and C have an extensive general discussion of AI
in Health and Medicine

## Introduction (A)

This lesson describes some overarching issues including the

-   Summary in terms of Hypecycles
-   Players in the digital health ecosystem and in particular role of
    Big Tech which has needed AI expertise and infrastructure from
    clouds to smart watches/phones
-   Views of Pataients and Doctors on New Technology
-   Role of clouds. This is essentially assumed throughout presentation
    but not stressed.
-   Importance of Security
-   Introduction to Internet of Medical Things; this area is discussed
    in more detail later in preserntation

## Diagnostics (B)

This highlights some diagnostic appliocations of AI and the digital
transformation. Part C also has some diagnostic coverage -- especially
particular applications

-   General use of AI in Diagnostics
-   Early progress in diagnostic imaging including Radiology and
    Opthalmology
-   AI In Clinical Decision Support
-   Digital Therapeutics is a recognized and growing activity area

-   AI to guide cosmetic surgery measuring beauty
-   AI in analysis DNA in blood tests
-   AI For Stroke detection (large vessel occlusion)
-   AI monitoring of breathing to flag opioid-induced respiratory
    depression.
-   AI to relieve administration burden including voice to text for
    Doctor's notes
-   AI in consumer genomics
-   Areas that are slow including genomics, Consumer Robotics,
    Augmented/Virtual Reality and Blockchain
-   AI analysis of information resources flags probleme earlier
-   Internet of Medical Things applications from watches to toothbrushes

## Covid-19 and Recession (E)

This is largely outdated as centered on start of pandemic induced
recession. and we know what really happenmed now. Probably the pandemic
accelerated the transformation of industry and the use of AI.
