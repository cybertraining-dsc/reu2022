# Docker Tutorial

Docker is a platform that allows users to develop, publish, and run 
software applications in packages known as containers. 

With Docker, users 
are able to run software on its host operating system, removing the need for 
virtual machines which consumes significantly more computing power.

Users are also able to share their containers through images on Docker's 
online platform: DockerHub. 

## Installation

Windows (Chocolatey): Go on Windows PowerShell and run as an 
Administrator and type in the following:

```
choco install docker-desktop -y
```

If Chocolatey isn't installed: Go on Docker's official website and click on 
which platform to install Docker on and download the installation file.

* https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ 

The following shows the links of instructions of how to install Docker on 
each type of operating system:

* Windows (without Chocolatey): 
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/ 

* MacOS:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/

* Ubuntu:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/ubuntu/

After having Docker Desktop installed, if it hasn't been done already, 
create a Docker account on their official website and log on to the account on 
the application after.

## Images

Images are essentially the blueprints of the containers. Already existing 
images can be pulled onto the local computer from the Docker Registry. This 
can be done using the `docker pull` command.
