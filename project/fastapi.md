FastAPI is a Python framework that allows developers to use the
RestAPI interface to call functions that implement
applications. RestAPI is used to call the common building block of an
application.


## FastAPI Install

There are two ways to install the FastAPI: either completely with the
`uvicorn` or partially with both the `FastAPI` and the `uvicorn`.

```bash
$ pip install "fastapi[all]"
$ pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
```

## FastAPI Example

The simplest FastAPI file could look like this:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

Copy it in a file called `main.py`.

Start the live server as follows:

``` bash
$ uvicorn main:app --reload 

INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO: Started reloader process [28720]
INFO: Started server process [28722]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.

```

There's a line that output something like:

```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This line displays the URL where your app is served on your local machine.

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

The JSON response will appear as:

```
{"message": "Hello World"}
```

* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

* OpenAPI :

  Using the `OpenAPI` standard for defining APIs, FastAPI creates a `schema` with all of your APIs.

  You can see it directly at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json.

It will display a JSON that starts with:

```json
{
    "openapi": "3.0.2",
    "info": {
        "title": "FastAPI",
        "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "paths": {
        "/items/": {
            "get": {
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": "Successful Response",
                        "content": {
                            "application/json": {


```

### Step 2: create a FastAPI instance

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

The variable `app` will be a "instance" of the class `FastAPI` in this
case.

This will be the primary point of contact for all API creation.

This is the same app that `uvicorn` refers to in the command:

``` bash
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If you create your app like:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

my_awesome_api = FastAPI()


@my_awesome_api.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
And copy it in a file `main.py` then you would call `uvicorn` like:

``` bash
$ uvicorn main:my_awesome_api --reload

INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Step 3: create a path operation

Path refers to the last part of the URL beginning with the first.  So,
in a URL like: `https://example.com/purple/flc` ...the path would be:
`/purple/flc`

"When developing an API, the `path` is the primary means of separating
"concerns" and "resources."

Operation

The term "operation" refers to one of the HTTP "methods."

When creating APIs, these specific HTTP methods are typically used to
perform a specific action.  Normally, you would use:

* POST: to generate data
* GET:  data retrieval.
* PUT:  updates data.
* DELETE: deletes data.

The HTTP protocol allows you to communicate with each path by using
one (or more) of these "methods."  As a result, in OpenAPI, each HTTP
method is referred to as a "operation."

#### Define a path operation decoratorÂ¶

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

### Step 4: define the path operation function

Our `path operation function` is as follows:

* path: is /.
* operation: is get.
* function: the function that comes after the "decorator" (below @app.get("/")).

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
This is an example of a Python function.

It will be called by FastAPI whenever it receives a GET operation
request to the URL "/".

It is an async function in this case.

Instead of async def, you could define it as a normal function:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

Reference: <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/>
@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```


### Step 5: return the content
```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

You can return a dict, a list, or singular values such as str, int,
and so on.

Pydantic models can also be returned.

Many more objects and models will be automatically converted to JSON
(including ORMs, etc). Try using your favorites; they are almost
certainly already supported.
