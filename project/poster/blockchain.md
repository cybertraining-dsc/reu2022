We presented on Thursday a blockchain paper.

## Abstract

Digitization is changing our world, creating innovative 
finance channels and emerging technology such as 
cryptocurrencies, which are applications of blockchain 
technology. However, cryptocurrency price volatility 
is one of this technologyâ€™s main trade-offs. In this 
paper, we explore a time series analysis using deep 
learning to study the volatility and to understand 
this behavior. We apply a long short-term memory 
model to learn the patterns within cryptocurrency 
close prices and to predict future prices. The 
proposed model learns from the close values. The 
performance of this model is evaluated using the 
root-mean-squared error and by comparing it to an 
ARIMA model.
